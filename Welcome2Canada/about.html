          <p class="ai"> An immigrant is defined as a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country. Canada is a nation that is built upon the immigration system because technically speaking every Canadian comes from a different hertiage and a line of immigrants, which we are so proud to celebrate. Without immigrants, Canada would not be where it is at the moment. Immigration is vital and essential to the positive growht of our nation and, in turn, it has become our identity, one of diversity and acceptance. With a large amount of immigrants arriving to the country and with more to come, our team believed it was neccessary to create a website that can make this transition to Canada way smoother than it already is! And that is how, we made Welcome2Canada! </p>

            <p><em class="kk">The main purpose of our website was to help immigrants get to know more about Canada, what they need to know about immigrating to Canada, and then a quiz to help the government understand their portfolio and ability in the English language. The website has several categories to help immigrants find a topic of interest to them that they might have a question on as well. One other mission of our website is to ease the stress immigrants may feel of going through the immigration process that takes time and energy, some of which an immigrant may lack depending on circumstance or health issues. We felt this was something important to incorporate because as any immigrant may know, the immigration process is no walk in the park. This was an important mission for our website as it helps immigrants, which is a social aspect of Canada in which we are so proud of and, in turn, want to contribute to a more accepting and inclusive Canada.</em></p>
