          <p>
            Immigrant is defined as a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country. Canada is a nation that is built upon the immigration system because technically speaking every Canadian comes from a different hertiage and a line of immigrants, which we are so proud to celebrate. Without immigrants, Canada would not be where it is at the moment. Immigration is vital and essential to the positive growht of our nation and, in turn, it has become our identity, one of diversity and acceptance. With a large amount of immigrants arriving to the country and with more to come, our team believed it was neccessary to create a website that can make this transition to Canada way smoother than it already is! And that is how, we made Welcome2Canada!
